## Abstract
COVID-19 is undeniably one of the worst incidents in the 21st century. There are a wide variety of factors that impact the spreading of COVID-19. This paper presents the study of relations of how public policy implementation might affect the onset and the spread of COVID-19 cases. Cluster analysis was employed to identify data patterns associating with the policy implementation profiles. The results suggest that the effectiveness of policy adoption relates to the onset spreading of COVID-19. This also indicates that the decision of public administrators was critical in the latter stage of the pandemic situation management.
